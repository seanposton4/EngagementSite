                <h1>Sean and Rachel</h1>
                <p>&emsp;   first met in fifth grade at Cape Christian school. Rachel fondly remembers Sean as being friendly and witty. He always had cute Adidas shoes, and was never afraid to read out loud when the teacher called on him. Sean always thought Rachel was annoying and loud. After sixth grade they parted ways for about six years.</p>
                <p>&emsp;    In the summer of 2015, they were both about to begin college. Rachel, invited by some friends, went over to Sean's house for a movie night. Sean and Rachel began to hang out. They would often go to the Cape Library and pretend to do homework, but it was just an excuse to see each other. After a few weeks of this, Sean asked Rachel to be his "date" for his cousin Katie's wedding. Rachel excitedly agreed but made sure he knew it was just as "friends." They hit it off at the wedding, and Rachel caught feelings for Sean when he offered his suit coat on the cold October night (his dance moves helped too).</p>
                <p>&emsp;     A week later Sean asked Rachel on a date. He said to dress "business casual" and specified it was a real date this time. Rachel still didn't think it was a real date, but she agreed to go anyway.</p>
                <p>&emsp;   Sean took Rachel to Cafe n Me in downtown Cape. They walked alongside the river wall together afterwards, chatting and laughing. It was cold and Sean gave Rachel his jacket, once again... and that's when it hit her! She was smitten by his kindness.</p>
                <p>&emsp;   After hanging out a lot the next couple of weeks after that, on November 8th, 2015 Sean asked Rachel to be his girlfriend officially. He wrote a really sweet poem asking her, and she was thrilled to say yes. The rest is history!</p>
